# Techno_economic_model_uncertainty_analysis
This Matlab code was developed for the journal article “Uncertainty quantification in the techno-economic analysis of emission reduction technologies: a tutorial case study on CO2 mineralisation” by Till Strunge, Phil Renforth, Mijndert Van der Spek submitted to Frontiers in Energy Research. To run this code, you need the TEA model published as Strunge, T. (2022). Techno-Economic Model for "Towards a business case for CO2 mineralisation in the cement industry". v1.0.0. doi: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5971924 (the corresponding journal article can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-022-00390-0). For running the script using global sensitivity analyses, you need UQLab version 1.4.0 or above, which can be downloaded for free at https://www.uqlab.com/.
